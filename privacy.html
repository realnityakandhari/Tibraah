    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Tibraah collects, uses, and protects personal information from customers worldwide.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>

    <h2>3. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to operate the website and analyse usage. Cookies help us remember sessions, preferences and provide performance analytics.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> required for core functionality (e.g., cart/session).</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> to understand site usage and improve the experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are located in a jurisdiction that requires it (e.g., EU), we will present a cookie notice and allow you to manage non-essential cookies.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use commercially reasonable measures to protect your data, including encrypted transmissions and access controls. No method of transmission is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
