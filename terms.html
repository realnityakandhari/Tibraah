    <p>These Terms govern your use of Tibraah's website and services (curation, sourcing, quality checks, packaging, and international delivery of Punjabi wedding apparel and gifts).</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By using Tibraah (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. Scope of Service</h2>
    <p>Tibraah curates and sources outfits, accessories, gifting and coordinates packaging and international delivery. We work with a network of vendors, tailors and couriers to fulfil orders placed by customers located worldwide.</p>

    <h2>3. Orders, Pricing & Payment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Order Confirmation:</strong> An order is confirmed when payment is received and we send an order confirmation.</li>
      <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Product prices shown are exclusive of customs duties and local taxes unless explicitly stated. We provide an estimated shipping slab at confirmation.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Payment in full is required prior to procurement. We accept the payment methods listed at checkout.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Shipping, Delivery & Customs</h2>
    <p>We will provide estimated delivery timelines at order confirmation. Timelines vary by destination and courier.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Estimates:</strong> Delivery estimates are not guarantees and may be affected by customs clearance, courier delays, weather or force majeure events.</li>
      <li><strong>Customs & Duties:</strong> Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the customer is responsible for all customs duties, taxes, and fees levied by the destination country. We will provide documentation to assist customs clearance.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk of Loss:</strong> Risk passes to the customer when the package is handed to the courier. We work with reliable couriers and insure shipments where feasible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Refunds, Returns & Replacements</h2>
    <p>We aim for complete satisfaction. Our returns and refunds guidelines are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Report Window:</strong> Report damaged or incorrect items within <strong>48 hours</strong> of delivery by emailing <a href="mailto:hello@tibraah.com">hello@tibraah.com</a> with photos and order details.</li>
      <li><strong>Eligible Returns:</strong> We accept returns for items that are damaged or materially incorrect. Items returned for reasons other than damage/incorrectness may be subject to inspection and restocking fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-returnable Items:</strong> Custom-fitted, altered, personalised items, and items explicitly described as non-returnable are not eligible for refunds unless defective.</li>
      <li><strong>Refund Processing:</strong> Approved refunds are processed within 7–10 business days to the original payment method. Shipping costs, customs duties and taxes are non-refundable unless the error is ours.</li>
      <li><strong>Replacements:</strong> When feasible we will replace damaged/incorrect items rather than refund.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Cancellation</h2>
    <p>Cancellation requests must be sent to <a href="mailto:hello@tibraah.com">hello@tibraah.com</a>. If procurement or tailoring has already begun, cancellation may not be possible or may incur charges.</p>
